# GitHub Repository Setup

To push this code to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository "workout_app"
   - Choose whether it should be public or private
   - Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license since we already have these files
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Connect your local repository to GitHub and push your code:
   ```bash
   # Add the GitHub repository as a remote
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/workout_app.git

   # Push your code to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Verify that your code has been pushed to GitHub by visiting:
